## Introductory Area

I have recently been reflecting on the affordance of social mediums and technologies—ie, interactivity on websites, ubiquity on mobile devices, and decentralization on distributed ledgers. As social beings, our goal is to communicate the processes of our cerebellar wetware—what otherwise might seem to be a black-box—to those of others'. This truth pushes me to view technologies as byproducts of this desire, which lead me to the following questions:

- What are the social dimensions in which these technologies significantly reside?
- How do they reside in relation to each other?
- How might these dimensions prove to establish a conceptual space of new modes of social interaction?
- How might this conceptual space birth future technologies?

~~What is essential is not so much the concepts but the dimensions between them.~~ 



Going from one medium to the next, we add a dimension labeled on the right. While each medium can be expressed in various ways, I chose to not distinguish between categories or examples—there are VR video games, or interactive board games. These terms help anchor concepts rather than establish definitive boundaries. Also, there might be valuable variation and nuance [as we increase dimensions](https://twitter.com/sterlingcrispin/status/1421689000360771587/photo/1).

What is essential is not so much the concepts but the dimensions between them. As social beings, our goal is to communicate the processes of our cerebellar wetware—what otherwise might seem to be a black-box—to those of others'.

i - ii brought shared language (semantic)
ii - iii  brought shared art (metaphorical)
iii - iv brought shared memories (temporal)
iv - v brought shared exchanges (interactive)
v - vi brought a radical sense of self (agent)

This final dimension expands the notion of agent-based social feedback across two dimensions: 1) internal-external and 2) reinforcing-expanding.

Mixed reality through multimodal/sensory stimulus interplay transports physical sensations into a crafted and curated world. The observer's spatial perception socially engages within this communication medium to intrinsically commit and reinforce the new reality. Distributed ledger technology extrinsically demands subscription to protocols that reinforce social constructs like trust across DAOs and digital communities. Creative artificial intelligence engages with external entities to expand notions of decision making with the intelligent other insofar as the axioms of artificial decision making are sufficiently complex—often using non-traditional artificial intelligence. Biohacking also pushes the boundaries of the social agent, however often in a sensory manner. All quadrants adapt the notion of "the social self" as an agent.

As we increase numbers dimensions:

How does the state-space of imagination change as we traverse dimensions?

How does this correlate to computational representations of different mediums?

Is there an underlying meta spanning these dimensions?

What are futures dimension?

How might the agent-based dimension expand?
